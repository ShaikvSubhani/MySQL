1>Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

select sum(population)
from city
where district = 'california';

2>Query the average population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

select avg(population)
from city
where district='california';

3>Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest integer.

select round(avg(population))
from city;

4>Query the following two values from the STATION table:

The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.

select round(sum(lat_n),2),round(sum(long_w),2) from station

5>Consider p1(a,b) and p2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
